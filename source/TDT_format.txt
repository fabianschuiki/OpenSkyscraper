SimTower .TDT SaveGame file format

Prelude notes:
The entire file format is little-endian (so native encoding), for Windows at
least. I don't have access to a Mac version to see if the endianness is
different for mac TDT files, nor do I know for certain if the two files are
compatible. I also only have access to a single version of SimTower, so other
versions may produce different results.

In terms of structure data, I will generally use char, WORD, and DWORD to mean
1 byte, 2 byte, and 4 byte values, respectively. I do not know which values are
to be treated as signed and which ones are unsigned, but it looks like most
WORD values are unsigned and most DWORD values are signed. When I have verified
signedness, I will mention it.

Another thing to mention is that the game does not appear to validate most of
the data, so you can end up with some wonky simulation values if the data is
not valid (for example, negative dates yielded a WD 0).

There is unfortunately a large amount of variable-width data, so I cannot give
precise location data for anything except the first block.

Various global constants
========================
WORD version
   This value should be 0x2400 (so laid out on disk as 00 24). If you don't see
   this value, then you should assume that this document is not correct.
WORD level
   1 = 1 star tower, 2 = 2 stars, etc., 6 = TOWER level
DWORD currentBalance
DWORD otherIncome
DWORD constructionCosts
DWORD lastQuarterMoney
   These are the amounts as shown in the overview of the finance window. See
   the General money notes for more information on interpretation.
WORD frameTime
   The current time, as measured in frames. See the How time works for more
   information on interpretation.
DWORD currentDay (signed)
   The current day, i.e., the number of days elapsed since WD 1, Q 1, Year 1.
   See "How time works" for more information.
WORD unknown
WORD unknown (lobbyHeight ????)
   This appears to be the height of the first-floor lobby.
char unknown[8]
   8 bytes of unknown value. Given context, probably 4 WORD values
WORD lrPixel
WORD udPixel
   These two values are the current screen location, measured in pixels. I don't
   recall if (0,0) is upper left or lower left corner.
char unknown[518]
   518 bytes of unknown data left in the header.

[Note: hex 0x2e may be the number of fast food, etc., places. need verification]

General money notes:
Money is actually inconsistently handled in the game. Most of the UI displays a
value 100 times that what is internally stored, with the exception of the
Finance Window (bizarrely). The manual does mention this complaint, though. The
save file, naturally, stores what is used for internal calculations, so it's
better to think of it as the UI just lies to you about most money valuations.


How time works:
0 starts at 7:00 AM and will reset 2600 frames later. These frames are divided
into 7 periods according to the time of day:
      Frames      Time (24-hr)              Conversions
1.    0 -  400 =  7:00 - 12:00  1 frame =  45 sec   30 min =  40 frames
2.  400 -  800 = 12:00 - 12:30  1 frame = 4.5 sec   30 min = 400 frames
3.  800 - 1200 = 12:30 - 13:00  1 frame = 4.5 sec   30 min = 400 frames
4. 1200 - 1600 = 13:00 - 17:00  1 frame =  36 sec   30 min =  50 frames
5. 1600 - 2000 = 17:00 - 21:00  1 frame =  36 sec   30 min =  50 frames
6. 2000 - 2400 = 21:00 -  1:00  1 frame =  36 sec   30 min =  50 frames
7. 2400 - 2600 =  1:00 -  7:00  1 frame = 126 sec   30 min ~= 17 frames

Note that the date value will change at frame 2300 (or, rather, the transition
from 2299 to 2300), so 2300 with day 0 is midnight of the first day. The periods
also, not coincidentally, refer to the number of the block in the elevator
panel, although the 7th period appears to be combined with the 6 period.

Days: the date is stored as a day counter, which is a signed 32 bit integer.
This means you can have a negative year--the game does not check for overflow.
The simulation appears to get screwy with negative time...
Day 0 = WD 1 / Q 1 / Year 1
Day 1 = WD 2 / Q 1 / Year 1
Day 2 = WE   / Q 1 / Year 1
Day 3 = WD 1 / Q 2 / Year 1
etc.

Remember that the initial value for the time is 2300 on day 0 (or maybe later,
the game starts up in fast mode, so grabbing a save of the initial state is not
easy).

Floor map
=========
The next section is the map of the tenants to the floors. This structure is
variable-width:

typedef struct {
  WORD numTenants
    The number of tenant entries in the floor.
  WORD leftEdge
  WORD rightEdge
    The leftmost and rightmost edges of any tenant on the floor.
  struct {
    WORD leftEdge
    WORD rightEdge
      The left and right extents of the current tenant. Note that floors and
      lobbies are coalesced to be one whole unit.
    char tenantType (signed)
      The type of the tenant. Negative values refer to tenants under
      construction.
    char unknown[3]
      3 bytes of unknown data. Probably a char and a word
    DWORD dataOffset
      This is the offset into the tenant data for information specific to this
      instantiation of the tenant. I don't know which data this is, though...
    char unknown[6]
      6 bytes of unknown data. The entire structure is 18 bytes long.
  } tenants[numTenants];
  char unknown[188]
    188 bytes of unknown data
} floorData;

floorData floors[120]
  There are 120 floors. Values 0-9 are B10, B9, etc., B1. Value 10 is the 1st
  floor, with value 110 being the 100th floor. There are another 9 extra floors
  above that, probably to let the screen just occupy the entire floor data map.

Given no underground floors, floor 1 is located at hex value 0x9c4, and floor 2
will be located at hex value 0xa98 if there is a 1-story lobby built.

Tenant information:
Each tenant has a distinct ID, which numbers ([*] is not confirmed):
0 - Floor
3 - Single Room[*]
4 - Twin Room[*]
5 - Hotel Suite[*]
6 - Restaurant[*]
7 - Office
9 - Condo
10 - Retail[*]
11 - Parking Space[*]
12 - Fast Food
13 - Medical Center[*]
14 - Security[*]
15 - Housekeeping[*]
17 - SECOM [1]
18 - Movie [2]
[ 19 - Movie floor 2? There is a gap here, so it makes sense ]
20 - Recyclying Center[*]
[ 21 - ? See above ? ]
24 - Lobby
29 - Party Hall[*]
[ 30 - ? See above ? ]
31 - Metro
[ 32, 33 - ? See above ?]
34 - Movie Theater [2]
[ 35 - ? See above ?]
36 - Cathedral
[ 37, 38, 39, 40 - ? See above ? ]
42 - "structures" [1]
45 - Parking Ramp[*]
48 - Burned Area[*]

[1] These values are mentioned in the resource 710.STRL. SECOM in particular
appears to have broader applicability, so I'm guessing it was a feature pulled
close to release.

[2] Movie Theater is listed in 710.STRL twice, so I'm not sure which one is
actually used for real Movie Theaters nor am I sure what happens if you use the
other one.

Left and right extents are measured in terms of individual floor units, so each
unit is about 8 pixels, with the left being 0x00 and the right being I don't
know.

Data for elevators and stairs do not appear to be in this map, as they are
handled separately later in the file. I also suspect that this data is sorted,
but I haven't played around enough to figure out if the game expects it to be.

Tenants themselves have more per-tenant-interpreted data, which is of variable
size... offices store 6 bytes of data while the fast food gets by with a
whopping 48.
